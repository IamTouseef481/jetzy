                        <strong> Information Collected via Social Networking Sites.</strong> The Services may allow users to log in through or connect with various social networking sites, such as Facebook (each an "SNS"). By logging in with or connecting with an SNS, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the SNS's terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from an SNS and that information may be imported to the Site (either as a part of your Profile or otherwise). Once you log in through or connect with an SNS, you may be able to post recent activity or content back to the SNS. Any information that we collect from an SNS may depend on your SNS privacy settings, so please consult the SNS' privacy and data practices. Further, you can edit privacy settings via the SNS, or disable the connection with the SNS by visiting the applicable SNS.

                        Information We Get From Others.  We may get information about you from other sources.  We may add this to information we get from this Site.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Information Collected via Technology.  </strong></p>
                    <div class="textBox">
                        <p><strong>Generally.</strong> When you use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you use our Services, your geographic location, how you use the Services, information about the type of device you use, your Open Device Identification Number ("ODIN"), date/time stamps for your visit, your unique device identifier ("UDID"), your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Site. In addition, in the event our App crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App.</p>
                        <p><strong>Log Files.</strong> We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, including IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve the content of the Site, market research purposes, to communicate information to visitors and to better tailor our Services to our users' needs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cookies. </strong> We may log information using "Cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website.

This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Analytics.</strong> We use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics) to help analyze how users use the Site. Analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use the information to improve our Site and Services. The analytics services' ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information. </p>

                    <p><strong>Information Collected from You About Others.</strong>  If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, you can go to the "Invite Friends" section of the App and can share an invitation code via Facebook or email.  </p>
                    <p><strong>Location Information.</strong> If you have enabled location services on your mobile device, we collect your location information to make a map available to the recipients of your messages showing your location.

                    <ul class="listBoxul">
                        <li>We may share personal information with your consent.  For example, you may let us share personal information with others for their own marketing uses.  Those uses will be subject to their privacy policies.</li>

                        <li>We may share personal information when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets.  These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.</li>
                        <li>
                            We may share personal information for legal, protection, and safety purposes.
                            <ul class="listBoxul">
                                <li>We may share information to comply with laws.</li>
                                <li>We may share information to respond to lawful requests and legal processes.</li>
                                <li>We may share information to protect the rights and property of Company, our agents, customers, and others.  This includes enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use.</li>
                                <li>We may share information in an emergency.  This includes protecting the safety of our employees and agents, our customers, or any person.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>We may share information with those who need it to do work for us.</li>


                    </ul>
                    <p>We may also share aggregated and/or anonymized data with others for their own uses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Social Networking Sites. </strong> The Site and Services may enable you to post content to SNSs (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter).  If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections.  You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs.  We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Public Profile.</strong> Certain portions of the information you provide to us may also be displayed in your Profile. By default, your Profile is public. Content you post to the Site is also meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Site, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put personal information in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Services, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).</p>

                    <p class="head">INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES</p>
                    <p>You may opt-out of providing your personal information to the App at any time by uninstalling the App.</p>
                    <p>
                        Our marketing emails tell you how to "opt-out." If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails.  Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may send requests about personal information to our Contact Information below.  You can request to change contact choices, opt-out of our sharing with others, and review, update, correct or delete your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can typically remove and reject cookies from our Site with your browser settings.  Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.  If you remove or reject our cookies, it could affect how our Site works for you.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Third Party Websites.</strong> Our Site may contain links to third party websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Site and go to another site and another entity may collect information from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit. The links to third party websites or locations are for your convenience and do not signify our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content, or websites.</p>

We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
                    <p><strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</strong> We do not currently respond to "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking on our Site.</p>
                    <p>A Note about Children. We do not intentionally gather personal information from users who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits personal information to us and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at <a style="color:#fff; text-decoration:underline" href="mailto:contact@jetzyapp.com">contact@jetzyapp.com</a>. </p>
                    <p><strong>Users Outside of the United States.</strong> If you are a non U.S. user of the Services, by using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Policy. In addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>
